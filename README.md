# BinaryCalculator task
 
The assignment is to create a binary calculator as a standalone WPF application which for fills these requirements:
 
•             GUI must be written in XAML (WPF)
•             GUI elements must scale with the window size. So if the user makes the application’s window larger then the buttons should also become larger.
•             UI does not need to have same layout as the picture which is enclosed, just use that as an example of one solution.
•             Needs to support both addition and subtraction operations
•             Possibility to press equals several times to repeat an operation
•             Display which shows result needs to toggle between showing result and showing user input based on last user interaction. For example if user presses "1" then display should show input but if user presses "=" then display should show result.
•             Does not need to support negative results.
 
8 GUI Elements:
•         “1” and “0” buttons for inputing 0 and 1s.
•         “-“ and “+” buttons for subtraction and addition
•         “CE” button which clears last entry or number. (So if you hit wrong input then CE clears it)
•         “C” button which clears everything
•         “=” button which performs operation
•         Display field which shows last input/result
 
We base the quality by:
•             The software functional quality which refers to how many features are complete, and how the UI challenge has been resolved.
•             The structural quality with emphasis on readability / maintainability and class structure.
